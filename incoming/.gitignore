# This directory is used for incoming packages
# Packages placed here will be automatically processed by GitHub Actions
# and added to the repository

# Legacy location - ignore packages in root incoming/ directory only
/*.deb

# New structure - packages go in subdirectories and should be committed:
# - incoming/stable/main/ for production releases in main component
# - incoming/stable/contrib/ for production releases in contrib component  
# - incoming/testing/main/ for development/beta packages in main component
# - incoming/testing/contrib/ for development/beta packages in contrib component
